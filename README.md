Easily synchronize issue labels across your (or your organization's) repositories.

1. Have one repo as a source of truth for how the labels should look like. This includes name, description, color and default option.
2. Create a Personal Access Token in your [GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta). Make sure it is assigned to the same account/org where the repositories are. The Token needs Read and Write access to Issues.
3. Select a list of target repositories where the labels will be copied. You can choose whether to create new ones, override existing ones and delete extra labels.
